# Duration Timer

Timer for some events that start and end in certain schedules.

- Countdowns for the specified start/end times
- Countups if it goes over the specified times
- Not aware of the date
  - It goes back to the countdown mode when it goes over 12 hours from the time
- URL query parameters contain the whole information: the start/end times and the title
  - You can bookmark (or do some fascinating alternative way you may know?) the generated page to save the setting and come back if you want it later
